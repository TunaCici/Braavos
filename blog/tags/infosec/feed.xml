      <description>What is SAML? Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties.
Source: Wikipedia
SAML is often used for single-sign on (&amp;ldquo;Sign in with Google&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Sign in with Twitter&amp;rdquo; etc.). It means when you want to log in to example.com, example.com can trust &amp;amp; use an external authentication provider to assert the user&amp;rsquo;s identity for you. SAML is about communicating these authentication &amp;amp; identity details across organization boundaries (web domains).</description>

      <description>Last year I discovered a serious security vulnerability (path traversal) that enabled me to read any file on the server GunDB runs in - I was even able to steal AWS credentials from the demo server.
Discovery I was having a chat with a buddy of mine about how much I dislike JavaScript, and I mentioned someone even built a database product with it. I also remember GunDB having let&amp;rsquo;s say.</description>

      <description>Every website will get hacked? Yes. It is starting to look like every website - even the major ones, will get hacked. It is not a question of &amp;ldquo;if&amp;rdquo;, but &amp;ldquo;when&amp;rdquo;.
Just now in the news is that Yahoo was compromised and the result was a leak of names, usernames, passwords and other personal data of 500 million accounts - almost twice the United States population.
Here are examples of a few widely known breached websites (up to September 2016 - this list grows constantly):</description>

      <description>Cyberchallenge from Finnish defence forces (edit: changed to archive.org link)
A colleague of mine found this. A pretty awesome test so see if you&amp;rsquo;ve got the skills (and if you do, my hats off to you!).
I know I didn&amp;rsquo;t know all of them. Plus, I don&amp;rsquo;t know enough about assembly.</description>
