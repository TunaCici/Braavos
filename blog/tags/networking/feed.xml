      <description>Hello and welcome to the final part of this ELI5 series. So far, we have learned the fundamentals of computer networking through questions like ‘what is networking?’, ‘what is the TCP/IP model?’ and ‘what are ports?’. We have covered most of the important networking terms, but there are still A LOT MORE things out there. However, let’s just leave them for future articles:)&#xA;In this final part we will not be explaining new networking terms, but instead we will use them to build something!</description>

      <description>Welcome to the part 3 of my Linux Networking ELI5 series! In the previous article, we have talked about IP addresses, the idea behind the NAT and DHCP servers.&#xA;Today’s stars are TCP/IP model, ports and firewalls. We will try to answer what they are, how do they work and how to use them in our Linux machines. Unlike the previous articles, this one will be more software centric. Meaning, there will be many terminal commands and practical examples.</description>

      <description>Hey everyone! In this article we are continuing our Linux Networking journey from where we left off. Previously, we made a simple introduction to networks, interfaces and basic Linux commands. Now, here in this article we will go deeper into the networking itself and talk about IP addresses, NAT, DHCP and more.&#xA;If you haven’t read the Part-1, I highly encourage you to give it a quick look. Most of the stuff here will make a lot more sense if you know about networks and interfaces.</description>

      <description>As we all know, Linux is a very powerful operating system. Even if it’s not as popular as Windows or macOS, it’s importance and power is no joke. Heck, it might even be the most important OS ever (depending on the person you ask) and there is a good justification for that.&#xA;Daily Time Spent Online — Source: oberlo.com&#xA;Look at the visualized data above. You can clearly see that we spent a lot of time on the internet.</description>
