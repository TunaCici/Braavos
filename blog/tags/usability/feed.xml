      <description>The use of 0-results-as-a-loading-indicator is really prevalent. It is horrible UX, as it is directly lying to the user.
Why is this a problem? &amp;ldquo;0 results&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;data is being loaded&amp;rdquo; are two different things, so we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t collapse them as the same message to the user.

      <description>Tax related issues are never too easy, so in communicating changes to your billing related tax procedures should be explained very clearly.
I received this email from Digitalocean:
It somewhat clearly states, that for individuals the price will be increased (&amp;ldquo;will include a VAT charge&amp;rdquo;).
How about for businesses? Will my price be increased? The words seem like yes (&amp;ldquo;your first invoice with VAT included will be sent&amp;rdquo; [on your next bill]).</description>
