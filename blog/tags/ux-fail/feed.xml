      <description>There are three requirements outlined, but they don&amp;rsquo;t reveal which one of them I don&amp;rsquo;t pass.
(I know it&amp;rsquo;s the two-factor thing, but that&amp;rsquo;s horrible UX.)
Detour: enabling 2FA Now when I went on to enable 2-Factor authentication for my admin account, I didn&amp;rsquo;t initially see it there:
Above are the two versions of the same page. When &amp;ldquo;2-Step Verification&amp;rdquo; is missing, it means that you don&amp;rsquo;t have the permission to enable it.</description>

      <description>Amazon Simple Email Service (&amp;ldquo;SES&amp;rdquo;) promises to be able to also receive email.
I use eu-central-1 (Frankfurt) region for my webservices.
I was frustrated not being able to find receive-related settings.
It was only after I came across some documentation I that realized the issue might be that not all regions support receiving:
=&amp;gt; Frankfurt region doesn&amp;rsquo;t support receiving email.
And sure enough, verifying this from UI, the menu item simply disappears when you&amp;rsquo;re in the wrong region:</description>

      <title>Amazon AWS: numbers need units to have meaning</title>

      <description>From Amazon &amp;ldquo;Simple Email Service&amp;rdquo;:
I can send one email? One during the lifetime of the universe? One per day? One per second?
The number has no meaning without a unit.
Only after you open the &amp;ldquo;more information&amp;rdquo; link, they tell you that the 200 is per day and the 1 is per second.
They&amp;rsquo;re using different units for numbers right next to each other, without specifying the unit. ðŸ¤¡</description>

      <description>Why does it have a button for [ Add to Desktop ] when I visit that page on mobile?
Why does it not explain why I can&amp;rsquo;t add it on mobile?
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to care whether I try ..
Brave on Android or Chrome on Android .. the result is the same.
Even more confusing is that when I visit with a desktop, it says:
Compatible with your device</description>
