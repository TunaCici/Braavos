      <description>Perkele! Finland just turned 100 years.
Growing up, I was never quite patriotic. I used to think that Finland is an insignificant country with shitty weather. I still think we have a shitty weather. But the more I&amp;rsquo;ve grown up, the more I&amp;rsquo;ve realized that in the grand scale of things Finland is actually pretty awesome!
I used to idolize the USA, I think because it&amp;rsquo;s a powerful and wealthy country, a notable portion of aired TV shows in Finland are from the US, and most tech things seemed to come from the US.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Anyway, back to shaping our lives.
