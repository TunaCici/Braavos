      <description>Look at the above painting. I mean really look at it. What do you see? Well, we see a human on the left (Adam) and the God on the right (with his/her angels) touching their fingers. But there is more to it. See the right side of the picture where the God stays. Doesn’t it look like a human brain? A doctor realized this similarity 500 years after the picture was drawn.</description>

      <description>Lately I’ve been thinking about personal computers and how it affected all of us. Yeah, it’s a bit cliché and cringy to talk about these type of topics. Everyone writes and talks about how computer are either the greatest or the most evil thing that ever existed. I’m not going to talk about either of them today. Today, I will talk about the future and do a little bit philosophy. It’s a gonna be a wild ride!</description>
