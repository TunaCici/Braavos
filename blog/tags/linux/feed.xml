      <description>The problem When I need some emoji, think ice cream üç¶, my (far from ideal) workflow has been to web search ice cream emoji and hope that the emoji is in search result text somewhere close for easy copying.
A (bloated) solution I&amp;rsquo;m already using Rofi, so when I came across Rofimoji at first I was excited that this solves my use case.
But I&amp;rsquo;d like to keep my computer as free from additional bloat as possible.</description>

      <description>Problem Suppose you have a file copy in progress (or some other long time -taking file operation). It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a progress bar, and you&amp;rsquo;re left wondering how long it&amp;rsquo;s progressed, and you can&amp;rsquo;t gauge it by comparing source and target file sizes for some reason.

Solution Turns out, Linux makes this task pretty easy, all you got to do is inspect is the file handle&amp;rsquo;s position.
