      <description>I just bought a mechanical keyboard from Drop.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t sign up for any mailing lists, but here&amp;rsquo;s how they rewarded me after giving them $ 225:
This is only about a week&amp;rsquo;s worth of emails, that I didn&amp;rsquo;t sign up for.
To top it off, from the unsubscribe link you&amp;rsquo;ve to separate click to unsubscribe for each different subject:
This is clearly a dark pattern to punish those who wish to unsubscribe.</description>

      <description>There are three requirements outlined, but they don&amp;rsquo;t reveal which one of them I don&amp;rsquo;t pass.
(I know it&amp;rsquo;s the two-factor thing, but that&amp;rsquo;s horrible UX.)
Detour: enabling 2FA Now when I went on to enable 2-Factor authentication for my admin account, I didn&amp;rsquo;t initially see it there:
Above are the two versions of the same page. When &amp;ldquo;2-Step Verification&amp;rdquo; is missing, it means that you don&amp;rsquo;t have the permission to enable it.</description>

      <description>All systems have glitches, but with PayPal it is systemic.
It is astonishing how often something doesn&amp;rsquo;t work in PayPal&amp;rsquo;s system:</description>

      <description>Email notification links not working Clicks from new comment notifications not taking me to the comment, but instead Disqus homepage (?!):
Signing in is not working Privacy issues The notification links seem to track my clicks:
Twitter login requests too many privileges:
Summary All systems have problems from time to time, but the amount of issues indicate a systemic problem. Disqus is garbage.
Need to research better options.</description>

      <title>Amazon AWS: hidden limitations</title>

      <description>Amazon Simple Email Service (&amp;ldquo;SES&amp;rdquo;) promises to be able to also receive email.
I use eu-central-1 (Frankfurt) region for my webservices.
I was frustrated not being able to find receive-related settings.
It was only after I came across some documentation I that realized the issue might be that not all regions support receiving:
=&amp;gt; Frankfurt region doesn&amp;rsquo;t support receiving email.
And sure enough, verifying this from UI, the menu item simply disappears when you&amp;rsquo;re in the wrong region:</description>

      <title>Amazon AWS: numbers need units to have meaning</title>
      <link>https://tunacici.com/blog/complaint-corner/2022/amazon-aws-no-units/</link>

      <description>From Amazon &amp;ldquo;Simple Email Service&amp;rdquo;:
I can send one email? One during the lifetime of the universe? One per day? One per second?
The number has no meaning without a unit.
Only after you open the &amp;ldquo;more information&amp;rdquo; link, they tell you that the 200 is per day and the 1 is per second.
They&amp;rsquo;re using different units for numbers right next to each other, without specifying the unit. ðŸ¤¡</description>

      <description>Why does it have a button for [ Add to Desktop ] when I visit that page on mobile?
Why does it not explain why I can&amp;rsquo;t add it on mobile?
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to care whether I try ..
Brave on Android or Chrome on Android .. the result is the same.
Even more confusing is that when I visit with a desktop, it says:
Compatible with your device</description>
